	abstract = {The manual production of reliable {RNA} structure models from chemical probing experiments benefits from the integration of information derived from multiple protocols and reagents. However, the interpretation of multiple probing profiles remains a complex task, hindering the quality and reproducibility of modeling efforts. We introduce {IPANEMAP}, the first automated method for the modeling of {RNA} structure from multiple probing reactivity profiles. Input profiles can result from experiments based on diverse protocols, reagents, or collection of variants, and are jointly analyzed to predict the dominant conformations of an {RNA}. {IPANEMAP} combines sampling, clustering and multi-optimization, to produce secondary structure models that are both stable and well-supported by experimental evidences. The analysis of multiple reactivity profiles, both publicly available and produced in our study, demonstrates the good performances of {IPANEMAP}, even in a mono probing setting. It confirms the potential of integrating multiple sources of probing data, informing the design of informative probing assays.},
