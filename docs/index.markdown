## IPANEMAP
 
IPANEMAP is a software for predicting stable RNA secondary structures compatible from multiple chemical probing (SHAPE, DMS, Enzymatic...) reactivities profiles. From one or several input sequences, along with several reactivity profiles, it computes and outputs one or several secondary structures, corresponding to the conformers best supported by experimental data and thermodynamics.
